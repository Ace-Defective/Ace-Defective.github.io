                    <p class="lead mb-5" style="text-align: center;">Hello World! My name is Aidan Dugan and I am currently a Security Specialist graduating with a degree in Cybersecurity Analytics and Operations with a minor in Security Risk Analysis from Penn State University (Hooray!) <br> <br> I was inspired to go into information security during my senior year of high school when I joined a pilot class for a program called "NuPaths". It was promised to be a dual enrollment opportunity to gain a number of college credits for careers within IT. I thought nothing of it at the time, but that class changed my life and set me on the path I am on today. I was inspired by the hands on knowledge I had received through the program and my professors encouraged me to pursue Cybersecurity further in my academic career going into college. <br> <br> I worked hard as a student working part time while maintaining my place within the Honors college at Penn State Harrisburg. During the summer of 2024 I interned at Select Medical, a fortune 500 company specializing in post acute healthcare. I worked within their Identity and Access Management department as an automation developer creating software robots for the automated provisioning of users. This summer project was then presented to a board of constituents including my peers, my mentors, and the C-level executives at the company. The company was so impressed with their work they offered to extend part time work to me so that I may continue my development of my automations. Currently the sum of my automations have provisioned access for thousands of users and have been estimated to free up over 600 FTE hours each year. <br> <br> Going forward, I hope to continue my professional development through education. I'm currently pursuing my CompTIA Security+ certificaiton as well as my SC-200 certificaiton to become more familiar with the Microsoft Security suite of applications.</p>

                    <p>Apart from being a security engineer. I like to spend my time vested in all kinds of nerdy interests. I love playing Dungeons and Dragons and other Tabletop Role-Playing-Games as well as digital role-playing video games. I'm an avid fan of high fantasy in fiction and you can often find me listening to an audiobook every moment I can</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">I like to spend a lot of time at my local game stores. I play Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh competitively and work to foster a community of tabletop game enjoyers. I am an aspiring chef, and I spend a good amount of my free time catching up on the latest trends involving information security and application development</p>

                    <p class="mb-0">This is a temporary section to explain the site to you. This is a personal resume and portfolio website I decided to design for my final project within your class of IST 402. One of the suggested final projects was to make a website and I decided to use the opportunity to finally make a working portfolio website. <br> <br> I did my best to follow the best practices we had learned in class. All relevant information should be center facing the user so that they don't have to rely on peripheral vision to view the information. I added a table of contents section as well for easier user navigation as was recommended in our section on UX design. I made sure to include images as well as words to illustrate the information I am trying to convey <br> <br> Some future points of development that I'd like to continue with this website is adding more pages. I went with a single frame design for this website initially, but in the future I would like to separate these tabs within the table of contents into individual pages. Additionally, I'd like to add a blog. I'm thinking that the blog will include tutorials for some of the projects I've worked on in your class as well as other classes. I feel I could make a blog post on the process of designing this website, and make other blog posts that highlight more of my skills. Finally, I'd like to add some staples seen on other webpages such as a contact me section with a working submission form. <br> <br> Overall, I'm happy with the work I've contributed so far to this web page and I'm looking forward to it's continued development as I hone my skills further in the future. Thank you for the opportunity to study and pursue web development within your class.</p>
